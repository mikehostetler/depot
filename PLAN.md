Here's a prioritized implementation plan for enhancing Depot:

1. Core Infrastructure Improvements
- Enhance Registry to support custom adapter process names
- Implement symlink support in adapter behaviour
- Add AdapterConfig struct for better configuration management, integrate with adapters
- Extend core Depot module to support instantiating multiple filesystems

2. Virtual Filesystem Layer
- Implement VFS manager as a GenServer
- Add mount/unmount functionality 
- Add ability to mount/unmount adapters under Root VFS paths
- Create path resolution system
- Support cascading operations across mount points
- Add mount point validation and conflict detection

3. Enhanced Adapter System
- Add support for read-only adapters
- Create base adapter behaviours for different capabilities
- Add streaming optimizations
- Implement the Env adapter as example/reference

4. Testing & Development
- Add ExUnit tags for filesystem operations
- Improve concurrent testing capabilities
- Add property-based tests
- Create helper modules for testing adapters
- Add documentation and examples

5. Advanced Features
- Add transaction support across operations
- Implement batched operations
- Create metadata system
- Add event system for filesystem changes
- Implement file watching capabilities

Would you like me to detail the implementation approach for any of these items?
